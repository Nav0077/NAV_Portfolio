### Plan:
1. **Adjust the Background Image in `index.html`:**
   - Modify the CSS for the `#hero` section to ensure the profile image is displayed correctly. This may include adjusting properties such as `background-size`, `background-position`, and `height` to ensure the image fits well within the section.

2. **Adjust the Image in `placeholder.html`:**
   - If necessary, add CSS rules to style the `<img>` tag for the profile image, ensuring it has appropriate dimensions and alignment.

### Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `assets/css/style.css` (to add or modify CSS rules)
- `assets/images/placeholder.html` (if adjustments are needed for the `<img>` tag)

### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the browser to ensure the profile image displays correctly.
- Make any additional adjustments based on visual feedback.
