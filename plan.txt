Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task of adding more containers:

### Plan:
1. **Identify Sections for New Containers**:
   - Determine where additional containers can be added in both `index.html` and `resume.html`. For example, we could add a new section for "Testimonials" or "Hobbies" in `resume.html`, and perhaps a "Services" section in `index.html`.

2. **Update `index.html`**:
   - Add a new section for "Services" that describes the services offered, including a brief description and any relevant details.

3. **Update `resume.html`**:
   - Add a new section for "Testimonials" that includes quotes or feedback from previous clients or colleagues.

4. **Styling**:
   - Ensure that the new sections are styled consistently with existing sections, using the same CSS classes and structure.

5. **Testing**:
   - After making the changes, test the layout in a browser to ensure that the new containers are displayed correctly and that the overall design remains intact.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in both HTML files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
