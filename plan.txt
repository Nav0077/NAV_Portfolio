### Plan:
1. **Assess Current Colors**: Review the existing color scheme in the `style.css` file to identify areas that may need color balance adjustments.
2. **Adjust Background Colors**: Consider changing the background colors to lighter shades or different hues to improve contrast and visibility.
3. **Modify Text Colors**: Ensure that text colors provide sufficient contrast against the background for better readability. This may involve changing some text colors to lighter or darker shades.
4. **Enhance Element Visibility**: Review elements like buttons, links, and hover states to ensure they stand out and are visually appealing.
5. **Test Changes**: After making adjustments, test the website to ensure that the color changes enhance the overall user experience.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the changes in the `style.css` file.
- Verify the visual appearance of the website after the adjustments.
- Gather feedback from the user regarding the changes made.
